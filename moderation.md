# Generic Discord Moderation Policies
*This is a brief set of expected practices built to be a generic catch-all for most common moderation incidents, and is designed to work in conjunction with the rule set from the GDSA project.*


## General Timeline:

###  First Offense:
Depending on the severity of the offense, the recommended first action is a warning, either typed directly by staff, or issued via a moderation bot.

### Second Offense:
The second offense constitutes a mute, with the time muted being left to the discretion of the moderator. A recommended starting time is 10 minutes for a standard infraction.

### Third Offense:
It is at this point that the user should be approached in a private room or their DMs in order to try to work towards a resolution of the issue. If the user is uncooperative or a resolution cannot be reached, the user will be kicked from the server.

### Fourth Offense:
The fourth and final level of infraction results in a ban, with the potential for the user to appeal if an administrator is respectfully notified.


## Notes:

### Skipping Steps:
The steps outlined above are not going to be applicable for every situation encountered on a server, and it should be assumed that moderators and administrators are allowed to skip steps if they determine the need to do so.

### Ban Appeals:
Administrators may decide to allow appeals on a case-by-case basis, or perhaps not at all. This is a matter of server policy and administrator preference.
