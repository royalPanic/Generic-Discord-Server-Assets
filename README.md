# The **Generic Discord Server Assets** project

The goal of this repository is to provide a basic set of open-source assets for people creating discord servers. There will be various documents and guides contained here to make setting up a public server easier for those who haven't done it before.

## Tentative Goal:
1. Ruleset
2. Moderation Policies
3. Staff Code of Conduct
4. Bot Guides (for common bots)
5. Server Quick-Start Guide
6. Server Structure & Permissions Guide

## Current Progress:
